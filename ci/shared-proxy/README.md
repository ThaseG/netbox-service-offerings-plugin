# Shared front-door reverse proxy

Multiple NetBox plugin demo deployments (this repo's, and potentially sibling plugin repos like
`netbox-certificate-plugin`) can share one runner. Only one process can bind host ports 80/443 at a time, so instead
of each plugin repo's pipeline running its own nginx bound directly to those ports, there's a single shared
front-door nginx that owns 80/443 and routes to each plugin's `netbox` container by domain name (SNI on 443, `Host`
on 80->443 redirect) — real name-based virtual hosting, not a port-per-plugin hack.

This directory is **not** part of this repo's own CI/CD pipeline. It's infrastructure shared across repos, so it's
set up **once, by hand**, and left running indefinitely; no plugin's `ci-cd.yml` starts, stops, or rebuilds it. What
each plugin's pipeline *does* do, every deploy: write its own domain's server-block file into the shared conf.d
directory below, and ask this container to reload — see `ci/scripts/render-proxy-conf.sh` in this repo.

The front door itself (its `docker-compose.yml`) only needs to exist in *one* of the plugin repos sharing a runner —
whichever one set it up first. This repo doesn't ship its own copy; if it's not already running on your runner, get
`ci/shared-proxy/docker-compose.yml` from whichever sibling repo owns it (e.g. `netbox-certificate-plugin`) and
follow the one-time setup below from there.

## One-time setup (per runner)

```bash
# 1. Create the shared external network every plugin stack's `netbox`
#    service joins (see ci/docker/docker-compose.yml's `edge` network).
docker network create netbox-edge

# 2. Create the host directories the front door bind-mounts. conf.d holds
#    one rendered *.conf per domain (one per plugin); certs holds one
#    subdirectory per domain (fullchain.pem + privkey.pem), written by each
#    plugin's own ci/scripts/issue-cert.sh.
sudo mkdir -p /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/conf.d /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/certs
sudo chown "$(whoami)" /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/conf.d /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/certs

# 3. Start the front door itself (docker-compose.yml from whichever repo
#    owns it — see above). It will boot with an empty conf.d (no domains
#    configured yet) — that's fine, each plugin's own next deploy populates
#    its own file and reloads it.
docker compose -f ci/shared-proxy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

After this, deploying (or re-deploying) any plugin repo against this runner "just works" — its pipeline renders its
own `<domain>.conf`, issues its own cert, reloads this container, and brings up its own stack joined to
`netbox-edge`.

## Adding another plugin repo to the same runner

1. Its `docker-compose.yml` `netbox` service needs to join the `edge` external network (`name: netbox-edge`) under
   its **own** stable alias — see this repo's `ci/docker/docker-compose.yml` for the pattern (`aliases:
   [netbox-service-offerings-plugin]`). Aliases must be unique across every repo sharing this runner, or the front
   door's `proxy_pass` can't tell them apart.
2. It needs its own `ci/shared-proxy/<its-alias>.conf.template` and its own `ci/scripts/render-proxy-conf.sh` (or
   equivalent), writing to `$EDGE_CONF_DIR/<its-domain>.conf` — a distinct filename from every other plugin's, so
   deploys never overwrite each other's routing.
3. Its `ci/scripts/issue-cert.sh` needs `CERT_DIR` pointed at `$EDGE_CERTS_DIR/<its-domain>` (this repo's script
   already defaults there — see that script's own `CERT_DIR` default).

## Removing this repo's own routing (e.g. decommissioning the demo)

```bash
rm -f /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/conf.d/<this-repo's-NETBOX_DOMAIN>.conf
rm -rf /opt/netbox-edge-proxy/certs/<this-repo's-NETBOX_DOMAIN>
docker exec netbox-edge-proxy nginx -s reload
```

Only tear down the front door itself (`docker compose -f ci/shared-proxy/docker-compose.yml down`) once **no**
plugin repo on this runner still needs it.
